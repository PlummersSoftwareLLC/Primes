## Description

This is an implementation in Centurion Programming Language (CPL), not to be confused with the CPL that is the [Combined Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPL_(programming_language)).

As the [CPU-5/CPU-6 Centurion Programming Language manual](https://github.com/Nakazoto/CenturionComputer/blob/main/Reference/CPU6%20Programmer%20Manual/02_CPL_ocr.pdf) states, _"CPL (Centurion Programming Language) is an English-orientated, complex computer language. While CPL bears similarities to COBOL, FORTRAN and PLl, it is a unique language with distinct characteristics."_ It is the business programming language for the Centurion minicomputer, built by the Texas, US based Warrex Computer Corporation.

The Centurion minicomputer is the topic of a [series of videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnw98JPyObn0wJFdbcRDP7LMz8Aw2T97V) on the YouTube channel [UsagiElectric](https://www.youtube.com/@UsagiElectric).

## Note on the implementation

Due to memory limitations that apply to CPL's execution environment on the Centurion minicomputer, the sieve limit for this solution is 100,000 instead of the usual 1,000,000.

## Run instructions

This solution can be compiled and executed on an actual Centurion minicomputer, or a sufficiently complete emulator. A list of known emulators can be found on [the respective page](https://github.com/Nakazoto/CenturionComputer/wiki/Emulators-and-Simulations) on Nakazoto's [CenturionComputer wiki](https://github.com/Nakazoto/CenturionComputer/wiki) on GitHub.
