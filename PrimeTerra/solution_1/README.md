# Terra solution by Enter1he


1-bit solution for counting the number of primes up to 1 million written in Terra programming language.
Is done mainly by converting CPP solution_1 to Terra code.

## Run instructions

There's no way to install Terra through the package so the best way is to get
release from a terralang/terra GitHub.
After that to run the program you need a Terra compiler in your PATH

Put the folowing command in terminal:
'''
terra Primes.t
'''
Resulting program would be right in the program folder

## Output
From AMD Ryzen 5 3500U 3.7 Ghz 4 cores
'''
