# Welcome to the attic

The attic is the place where you store things that you no longer need, but are still handy to keep. The same is for this attic. This directory contains different scripts and tools that where used to develop the best SQL script as used by the actual program.

Based on various test results, script `in_two_steps_2.sql`, has the best performance and is closest to the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) algorithm.
