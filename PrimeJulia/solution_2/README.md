[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a dynamically typed language made for performance.
Instead of classes, the main programming paradigm is multiple dispatch:
functions are dynamically dispatched on the types of all arguments,
not just one like in OOP (the implicit `this` argument).
Therefore, methods don't belong to a specific type.

Here, the algorithm constructs a `Primes` object,
which is just a wrapper for the array of Booleans,
and overloads of some standard library functions are defined
so that the object can be treated as a collection of prime numbers
(e.g. since iteration and reverse-iteration are implemented,
we can easily and efficiently show the first and the last 5 primes).

Performance is achieved through a JIT, or "just-ahead-of-time" compliler (as they call it),
which makes it feel lika a fast scripting language.

This is how you run the code from the command line:
```
$ julia Primes.jl
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, …, 999953, 999959, 999961, 999979, 999983
Passes: 6581, Time: 5.000025987625122, Avg: 0.0007597669028453308, Limit: 1000000, Count: 78498
epithet;6581;5.000025987625122;1;algorithm=base,faithful=yes,bits=1
```

You can also pass the limit as an argument:
```
$ julia Primes.jl 30
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29
Passes: 6913442, Time: 5.0, Avg: 7.2322874770628e-7, Limit: 30, Count: 10
epithet;6913442;5.0;1;algorithm=base,faithful=yes,bits=1
```

There are unit tests to verify the implementation (this can take a minute):
```
$ time julia test.jl 
Test Summary:         | Pass  Total
Sieve of Eratosthenes |   56     56

real	0m35.578s
user	0m35.615s
sys	0m0.627s
```

You can also do some benchmarking from the REPL:
```
julia> include("Primes.jl")

julia> @time Primes(1_000_000)
  0.000741 seconds (3 allocations: 61.172 KiB)
Primes(1000000)

julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("BenchmarkTools")

julia> using BenchmarkTools; @benchmark Primes(1_000_000)
BenchmarkTools.Trial:
