In Elixir it is possible to address a single bit in a binary (or what other programming languages call a string (technically not exactly the same) ). This is just a show case that it is possible, because it is not really fast and also not readable.

## Run instructions

```sh
MIX_ENV=prod mix run -e 'PrimeSieve.main'
```

## Output

```
