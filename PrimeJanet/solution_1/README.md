This is just my implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm implemented via a boolean array

## Run instructions

Install janet easily done via homebrew or download binaries [here](https://github.com/janet-lang/janet/releases)

cd into the solution folder and run either the `run.sh` script or via the janet cli: `janet main.janet`

With docker:

docker build -t janet-sieve .
docker run --rm -it janet-sieve
```

## Output
This is a sample output from my machine
```
Musab-Nazir;193;5.15975;1;algorithm=base,faithful=yes

```
