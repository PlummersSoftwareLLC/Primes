![example workflow](https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=drag-race)

## Community contributions

Community contributions, fixes and improvements are accepted on this branch. If you want to add your own solution, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Running the benchmarks

The vast majority of benchmarks (solutions) in this repository can be built and run with one Makefile. This is described in [BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md).

## Viewing results

The [PrimeView web application](https://plummerssoftwarellc.github.io/PrimeView/) can be used to view, filter and sort results generated by Dave's benchmark machine. It is our intention to add results of other systems in the future. **Note** that any feedback, suggestions, PRs concerning PrimeView need to be made on [the application's own repository](https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/PrimeView).
