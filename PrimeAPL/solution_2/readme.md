# APL solution by Garklein
This is an APL implementation of the prime sieve.
I'll probably go over it line by line later here

## Run Instructions
This only seems to work on Linux, Dyalog APL doesn't really want to run from the command line.  
Make sure you have [Dyalog APL](https://www.dyalog.com/download-zone.htm?p=download) installed, and added to the path.  
Run `run.bat `.

## Output
`garklein-dfn;2375;5.002;1;algorithm=base,faithful=yes,bits=1`
