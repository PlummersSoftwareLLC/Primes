# Rust solution by Blui42

![Category](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-faithful-green) 

This is mostly a 1:1 implementation of the C++ code in rust.
Uncomment line 61 for an output of all the primes.

## Run instructions

This requires rust to be installed.

```cargo run --release```

This will compile and run the program.

The executable can afterwards be found and executed in `/target/release/`.

## Output

This was run on a Windows Machine with AMD Ryzen 5 1600 Six-Core Processor 3.20 GHz.

Only line 2 is on standard output, the rest is on standard Error.
