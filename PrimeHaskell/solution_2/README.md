# Haskell "Loop Unpeeling" solution by GordonBGood

This Haskell solution is implemented in an imperative style using `forM_` so that the core algorithm remains recognizable.  Unlike the earlier solution, this solution does not use imported libraries to accomplish the task, so thus is `faithful to base`.  The number representation is one bit per odd number.

The implementation uses the a similar algorithm as the Rust "striped" algorithm but instead of changing the order of bits within the sieve buffer, leaves the order and culls/marks them by "stripes" in place, so thus is `faithful base`.  The actual loops are very simple and thus no separate storage implementation is used.  The outer loop starting at code line 57 searches for the base prime values as required; The next inner loop level has a limit set at code line 63 so that it never runs more than eight times, then loops starting at code line 66 by just setting up the constant mask value and starting byte index to be used in the innermost actual marking loops as per code lines 68.  The boolean deliverable array is returned at code line 69.

Note that there are two views into the same array as set up in code lines 52 to 54, one as a boolean one-bit-per-value array and one as a Word8 byte array, with search for base prime values done in the boolean representation and culling done in the Word8 byte representation for the "striping"/"loop unpeeling" algorithm.  The returned view is the boolean one because then we can use the Haskell built-in `assocs` function to produce the returned lazy list of prime values as a list comprehension in code lines 41 and 42.

The second implementation differs from the above in two respects:  It implements some basic loop unrolling (by four loops), and it runs all up to eight bit "unpeeling" loops over once CPU L1 cache-sized "page" at a time and repeats for all the required "pages" in order to get better cache associativity (less cache "thrashing").  To do this easily, it uses a small eight-integer array created at line 90 just below where the two views into the sieving buffer array were created.  Then, for each base prime value to be used for marking of composite representation bits, it fills this small array with the initial start byte indices at lines 91 and 92, followed by the rest of the loops, first by buffer "page" starting at line 93, then by the up to eight "bit-loops" starting at line 99, and then the marking loops.  For this implementation, marking is broken up into two phases, with the first unrolled loop starting at line 184 and the second single mark per loop starting at line 118 doing the marking up to the end of the page when there are less than four markings to be done.  This implementation uses `foldM` as necessary to thread the current marking value through the loops so that it can be saves back to the current bit position location in the small eight value array for use in the next page pass, which saving is done at line 123.  As before, the boolean view is returned to be easy to scan for unmarked values and convert to prime values using the `assocs` function in line 74.

## Run instructions

If you have [GHC Haskell installed on your machine](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_8_10_5.html); on Windows, LLVM does not work on Windows for versions newer than 8.6.5 up to 9.0.1 so [version 8.6.5 must be used](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_8_6_5.html).

Once LLVM and GHC Haskell are installed (as well as GIMP if using that version), just run "ghc primes" to compile and "./primes" to run the application.

Otherwise, use the provided `Dockerfile`.
