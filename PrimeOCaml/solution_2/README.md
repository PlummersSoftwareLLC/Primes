# OCaml solution by @gkpotter

An unfaithful implementation of the prime sieving algorithm using a functional approach in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org).

## Run Instructions
### Run Locally
#### Install OCaml and OPAM:

[OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org) is the OCaml package manager. For more info on how to install both OCaml and OPAM, check out the OCaml [installation guide](https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html).

#### Install OCamlbuild and Core
[OCamlbuild](https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild) is a convenient builder for simple projects, and [Core](https://opensource.janestreet.com/core/) is an alternative standard library for OCaml, both of which can be installed using OPAM via:
```
opam install ocamlbuild
opam install core
```
#### Build and Run
Build and run using corebuild via:
```
corebuild PrimeOcamlFunctional.native
./PrimeOCamlFunctional.native
```

### Docker
As an alternative to running locally, build and run using docker via:
```
docker build -t prime-ocaml-functional .
docker run --rm prime-ocaml-functional
```
