This is an implementation in Object Pascal, or Free Pascal "ObjFPC mode" to be exact.

It uses a bitpacked array to reduce memory usage.

## Run instructions

### Free Pascal
Execute the following commands from the implementation directory:
```
fpc prime
./prime
```

### Docker
A Dockerfile has been provided.

## Output
```
circular17;3406;5.00;1;algorithm=base,faithful=yes,bits=1
```
