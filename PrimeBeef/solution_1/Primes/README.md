* `Primes/src/Primes.bf` uses 1 bit for each sieve item

## Caveats

The docker image only works on an AMD64 architecture. I was not able to get the
[Beef docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rzuckerm/beef) to build using ARM64.

## Run instructions

Build the docker image with this:

```bash
./build.sh
```

You should only need to do this once. Run the docker image:

```bash
./run.sh [<options>]
```

where `<options>` are optional command-line arguments:

* `--limit=<limit>` - Upper limit for calculating prime. Default value is 1000000
* `--time=<time>` - Time limit in seconds. Default value is 5
* `-s` - Print found prime numbers
* `-h` - Show help
