# FreeBASIC solutions by rbergen

![Category](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-faithful-green)

This is a collection of implementations in FreeBASIC, of which:
1. one is effectively a FreeBASIC copy of the "8 of 30" implementation that [mckoss](https://github.com/mckoss) has written in C
2. one is a "naive" implementation that maintains the array of (non-)primes in an underlying array of bit-mapped 32-bit unsigned integers
3. one is a "naive" implementation that maintains the array of (non-)primes in an underlying array of bit-mapped 64-bit unsigned integers
4. one is a "naive" implementation that maintains the array of (non-)primes in an underlying array of booleans

## Run instructions

### FreeBASIC
Execute the following commands from the implementation directory, in a bash shell:
```
find . -name 'prime_*.bas' -exec fbc {} \;
. runprimes.sh
```

### Docker
A Dockerfile has been provided.
