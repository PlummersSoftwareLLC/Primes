This is an initial stab at a Lean4 implementation. Other than directly translating the algorithm, not much has been done to optimize this implementation.

## Run instructions

- Install the Lean version manager [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan).
- Run `leanpkg build bin` in the solution directory
- Run `./build/bin/PrimeLean4`

## Output

```
badly-drawn-wizards;1352;5.001000;1;algorithm=base;faithful=yes;bits=8
```
