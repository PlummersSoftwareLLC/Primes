# Perl implementation

## Description

It's a bit rough around the edges; hopefully, it will get better in time. The same drill, running 20 iterations of the program sequentially.

Yep, it's slow. 

## Installation

Perl usually ships by default on all Linux/Unix systems; type `perl` in the command line. If it's not there, check your package manager. On Windows, there are dedicated distributions like Strawberry Perl or ActivePerl.

## Running in docker

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose run --rm primes
```
