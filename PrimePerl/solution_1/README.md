# Perl implementation

## Run

### Running locally

Perl usually comes preinstalled on a Linux system; if it's missing from your machine, check your package manager. For Windows, there's ActivePerl or Strawberry Perl.

```
perl primes.pl
```

### Docker

No local Perl? Just run it in Docker.

```
docker build -t primes .
docker run --rm primes
```

## Benchmarks

It's slow, even though I tried a few optimizations. I also tried to avoid installing modules from CPAN since that wouldn't be fair as they might be implemented in C/C++. 

On my M1 MacBook Air, I get the following numbers:

```
