.SYNOPSIS 
Computes primes using the sieve of Erastosthenes for the purpose of
benchmarking.

.DESCRIPTION
This is a PowerShell implementation of davepl's sieve of Erastosthenes for
benchmarking programming languages and CPUs. It is based on crowbar27's
PowerShell solution #1, but inlies the Get-Bit and Clear-Bit functions, which
greatly improves performance.

The implementation computes primes up to a given maximum number (1000000 by
default) and repeats this process until a user-specified minimum time
(5 seconds by default) have elapsed. The results are writting to standard
output in the format described at
https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes/blob/drag-race/CONTRIBUTING.md
and also emitted to the pipeline as PsObject.

.PARAMETER SieveSize
The SieveSize parameter specifies the maximum number up to which the prime
sieve should look for primes. This parameter defaults to 1000000.

.PARAMETER MinimumRuntime
The MinimumRuntime parameter specifies the minimum number of seconds that the
script should run. If this value is not reached while computing a sieve of
the specified size, an additional pass of the same size is started. This
parameter defaults to 5.

.PARAMETER ResetState
The ResetState switch instructs the script to reset the bit array instead of
reallocating the state object in every iteration. Results using this switch
are not faithful according to
https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes/blob/drag-race/CONTRIBUTING.md.

.PARAMETER ShowResults
The ShowResults switch instructs the script to write all primes that have been
found to the console.

.INPUTS
None. You cannot pipe objects to this script.

.OUTPUTS
A PsObject containing the test results, namely the number of passes that have
been completed, the overall duration of the test and the primes that have been
found.
