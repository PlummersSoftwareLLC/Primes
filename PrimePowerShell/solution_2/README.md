# PowerShell solution by Christoph MÃ¼ller (crowbar27)

This PowerShell implementation of the sieve of Erastosthenes is derived from crowbar27's PowerShell solution #1. It addresses the fact that function calls extremely slow down PowerShell. Therefore, the calls to `Get-Bit` and `Clear-Bit` have been replaced by inline code. Note that this only optimises one run of the sieve and there is further potential for optimisation by "inlining" the call to a single run as well.

The implementation differs in the naming of some functions, which have been renamed to use [approved verbs for PowerShell commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands?view=powershell-7.1) instead of the method names used by davepl. As PowerShell does not support integer division and the results would have to be rounded using `[System.Math]::Floor`, the access to the bit array (`$Index / 2`) has been replaced with shifts (`$Index -shr 1`).

Furthermore, the implementation returns the results of the run as a `PsObject` to the pipeline, which can be discarded by piping to `Out-Null`.

## Run instructions
Run `.\PrimePowerShell.ps1` in a PowerShell. In order to suppress the pipeline output and only have the results written to the console in the standard output format, use `.\PrimePowerShell.ps1 | Out-Null`.

## Output
Intel Core i7-9700K on Windows 10 Professional 21H1 with PowerShell 5.1.19041.906 for a sieve size of 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000 and 1000000:
