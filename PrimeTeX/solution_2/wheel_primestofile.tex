% Customize Range
% ===============

\ifx\Range\undefined
\def\Range{1000000}% limited to somewhat less than 295,000,000 with tex/etex/pdftex,
                   % and to 999,999,999 if running with lualatex
\fi

% Usage
% =====

% Compile this file with either
%
% tex
% etex
% pdftex
% luatex

% e.g
% tex wheel_primestofile
%
% or (adapt the quoting to your shell) for a custom range
%
% tex \\def\\Range{10000}\\input wheel_primestofile

% To allow compilation with base Knuth tex, the built-in
% timing via \pdfresettimer/\pdfelapsedtime is automatically
% unactive if the run is via "Knuth tex".
%
% Use "time" if desired, e.g.
%
% time tex \\def\\Range{10000000}\\input wheel_primestofile

% See wheel_primestofile_timings.txt

% activate @ as a letter for being more mysterious
\catcode`@ 11
% and use also _ as a letter to appear even more TeXnical
\catcode`_ 11

\input wheel_sieve.tex

\input shared_primestofile.tex
