% Prime Sieve with TeX
% author: jfbu
% date:   2021/07/24--2021/08/06
%
% This file defines syntax for a  "Sieve object" in TeX lingua with its
% associated methods: sieve, reset, settocount, outtofile.
%
% Usage:
%
% \NewSieve{<name>}{<range>}
%
% \Sieve <name>.sieve{} executes the sieve
% \Sieve <name>.reset{} resets all array entries to 0
%
% after sieve method has been executed one has access to:
%
% \Sieve <name>.settocount{\macro} sets \macro to the number of primes
% \Sieve <name>.outtofile{<filename>} ships out all found primes,
%    one per line to file <filename>.
%    It will also write to stdout the number of primes found
% 
% Algorithm:
%
% essentially this is the "Base Algorithm" as described in
%
% https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes/blob/drag-race/CONTRIBUTING.md
%
% In particular:
%
% - inner loops start at factor*factor
%
% - increments in the inner loops go (morally) by step of 2*factor
%
% Some specifics:
%
% - primes are marked as 0, non-primes as 1. The array entries type is
%   a TeX dimension, which pdftex represents (I think) as 32bits words.
%   So more precisely primes are marked as 0sp and non-primes as 1sp.
%   * update on August 5: use \dimen's \z@ and \onesp for significantly
%     faster assignments; I knew this would bring some gain but I did not
%     expect it as big as it turned out.
%   * update on August 6: use = sign for all assignments. Faster. Also,
%     I tested "by" for \advance but it is definitely slower adding it
%   * putting the replicated bodies in "\action" macros is also definitely
%     slower
%   * the \romannumeral in \Replicate is a legacy from where this macro
%     was taken (xintkernel.sty, which itself cloned it from latex3)
%     and serves nothing
%     Surprisingly tests with luatex 1.13 definitely show it is advantageous.
%     But tests with the luatex 1.07.0 from the Docker container are less
%     conclusive... perhaps because there are less files in the texmf trees,
%     as unexpectedly this is sensitive to whether TEXMFCNF is set or not!
%     Weird and we are entering areas where
%     things are more or less pronounced depending on engine (pdftex,
%     luatex, dev version of successor of luatex...)
%   * using \ifcase rather than \ifdim\foo=\z@ is faster (thanks to HH)
%   * I test the above with luatex as it is used for benchmark. I hope
%     my luatex 2021 behaves as luatex 2018 from the Docker image...
%
% - index j stands for the number 2j+1 and starts at j=1. So the sieving
%   array in memory represents only odd numbers, first one 3.
%
% - For a range N (at least 3) we thus instantiate an array of J "32bits
%   words"
%   with maximal J such that 2J+1<=N, i.e. J=(N-1)//2.
%
% Acknowledgements:
%
% - thanks to Kpym for helping me out with docker matters, and
%   for drawing my attention to this "drag race" to start with
%
% TeXnicalities:
%
% - ////                                                   \\\\
%   This library file uses only base Knuth's tex, i.e. it
%   doesn't use the e-TeX extensions such as \numexpr but,
%   only the TeX's syntax with \multiply, \divide, \advance.
%   \\\\                                                   ////
%
% - TeX has no native array type so we use "font dimension arrays".
%   There is no way that I know of to release the memory, only
%   to re-use it (and the array size can not be modified as soon
%   as some other font is defined).
%
% - The native font memory size available in pdftex is only
%   of 8,000,000 words. To sieve up to about or more than
%   about twice this, it is needed to tell pdftex to run
%   with more (static) font memory. For this see file texmf.cnf
%   and/or the README.md
%
% - luatex has dynamic memory allocation so is not constrained
%   but maximal N is at 999,999,999 due to a limitation
%   (which could be lifted) from a shared_batteries.tex
%   auxiliary macro (square root)


% activate @ as a letter for being more mysterious
\catcode`@ 11
% and use also _ as a letter to appear even more TeXnical
\catcode`_ 11
