% default TeXLive texmf.cnf font_mem_size is 8000000
% we will set it to                        147483647
% which is the maximal authorized value (without a change requiring
% re-compiling the pdftex binary itself).
%
% For a range as in the benchmark of 1,000,000 each pass consumes
% 500,000 words of memory (each 32bits) so this allows about
% (147483647-20000)/500000 =294.9.. i.e. 294 passes, max.
%
% To activate this memory setting execute
%    export TEXMFCNF="$(pwd):"
% in working directory
%
% runpdftex.sh does this before launching pdftex
%
% luatex has dynamic memory allocation and does not need this.
