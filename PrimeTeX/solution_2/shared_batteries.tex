% NESTABLE (and expandable) LOOP
% ==============================

% Plain TeX's \loop has some problems, e.g.
% \def\macro{... do something with \loop...\repeat...}
% then do some \loop...use \macro...\repeat will be broken
% in general as external \loop defines a \body which will be
% overwritten by inner \loop...
% So let's borrow the \xintloop from xintkernel.sty renaming it into xloop

% INTEGER SQUARE ROOT
% ===================
% input must be non-negative and at most 999999999 
%                  (TeX's max number is 2147483647)
% auxiliary used for not too bad starting point of the algorithm
% count how many tokens but input **must have at most 9 tokens**
% usage: in completely expanding context
