This is an implementation in object-oriented Tcl. Historically, Tcl did not have native support for object-oriented programming. As of version 8.6 however, Tcl includes a built-in object oriented system.

This implementation the object-oriented feature of Tcl. It uses two classes, `bit_array` and `prime_sieve`. The `bit_array` class implements a bit array with basic get and set methods. It uses a 32 bit string array to represent the bit values. The `prime_sieve` class is used for the actual sieve calculation.

This implementation is based on:

- Python/solution_2, by ssovest
- PrimeCPP,          by Dave Plummer
- [Bit vectors](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Bit+vectors), by Richard Suchenwirth

## Run instructions

### Run native

To run this solution you need Tcl. The Tcl shell (`tclsh`) is included in most Linux distributions.

```bash
cd path/to/sieve
tclsh primes.tcl
```

### Run with Docker

To run with Docker take the following steps:

1. Install Docker: <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>
2. Build the image:

    ```bash
    docker build --pull --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t ootcl:latest "."
    ```

3. Run with Docker:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it  ootcl:latest 
    ```

## Output

Below is an example of the output on my machine, running with Docker.

```bash
docker run --rm -it  ootcl:latest 
Passes: 4, Time: 6.476, Avg: 1.619 (sec/pass), Limit: 1000000, Count: 78498, Valid: true

fvbakel_ootcl;4;6.476;1;algorithm=base,faithful=yes,bits=1
```

These results are with the following conditions:
- Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3520M CPU @ 2.90GHz, Lubuntu 21.04 64 bit
- tcl: 8.6.11
- running in Docker container alpine:3.13
- Docker version 20.10.2, build 20.10.2-0ubuntu2
