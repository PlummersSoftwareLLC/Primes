*This implementation follows the original implementation by Dave and uses BitSet rather than arrays. Performance is lower compared to arrays but we are no longer limited to `Integer.MAX_VALUE - 2` (Requested array size exceeds VM limit).*

## Run instructions

*Standard Maven project*
*Java 11+ should be available in the system path if you want to run manually*
*For manual execution, `run-sieve` or `run-sieve.cmd` based on your enviroment*

## Output

```
Passes: 2487, Time: 5.000000, Avg: 0.002010, Limit: 1000000, Count: 78498, Valid: true
